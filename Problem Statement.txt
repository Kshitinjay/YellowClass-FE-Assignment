Problem Statement: Build a simple photo feed using ReactJs (Next.js preferable) to display images in a masonry format (refer pinterest feed) Features to build - Use the unsplash API to get the list of photos (https://unsplash.com/developers) - Infinite scroll in the photo feed - On clicking any photo, open that particular photo in a modal and put arrows on the left and right side to navigate to the previous and next photo respectively. (Brownie points for building a custom modal and for animating the image transition) Bonus Task - Integrate a mechanism to lazy load images and only keep those images in the DOM which are currently visible on the browser screen/viewport. (you can use react-virtualized) Brownie points for hosting the frontend application on a platform like netlify.com or vercel.app Final sample of the listing: http://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/Masonry Company exact stack requirement: React, HTML, CSS, javascript CTC: 6LPA Location: Gurugram (Remote working for a long time upto1 year) Remarks: Candidates must be really strong in Reactjs and javascript as the assignments will be based on that. Hosted projects on Github on React will be an added advantage.
